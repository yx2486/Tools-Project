## Description:
***Clustering*** is a simple python library that could perform Hierachical Clustering. It could easily create different clusters from a list of data provided. In this package, three types of linkages can be performed, which are "single", "complete" and "average".

## Basic Algorithm of Hierachical Clustering:
1. Compute the proximity matrix based on data provided
2. Let each data point be a cluster
3. **Repeat**: Merge the two closest clusters; Update the proximity matrix
4. **Until** only a single cluster remains

## How to Use:
